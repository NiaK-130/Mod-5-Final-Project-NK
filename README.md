# Mod-5-Final-Project-NK

**Sweet Project Title**

This is the part where I tell you about the project. The "pitch", if you will. I'm giving you a high level overview of what the project does, and why I decided to build it. This doesn't have to be extensive, just a quick overview.

This is the repo for, say, the frontend of the app. It's hosted here and the backend repo is here.

User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to create an account, so I can log in and use the app.
As a user, I want to be able to see my user info, so etc etc etc
As an editor, I want to be able to do an admin thing, so I can etc etc
(Have one story for each feature you plan to includeâ€”even small features are great to list here, so feel free to get granular with it. You'll probably be making a new branch for each of these, right?)

Models and Relationships
This is a good place for a sweet diagram:

API
Here's where you want to describe each API endpoint you're building/using. You can put this in your front end repo, your back end repo, or both.

GET /api/users
Returns a list of all users. Response JSON looks like this:

{ 
  id: 111,
  username: "johndoe",
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  etc: "etc"
}
POST /api/users
Creates a new user. Say more about that here. Send this data:

{ this is what it takes as data }
And this is what it returns:

{ this is what you get back }
Wireframe / Mockup
Put your sweet wireframes and mockup images here. Probably only goes in the front end repo.
