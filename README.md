This is a good place for a sweet diagram:


**API**

Here's where you want to describe each API endpoint you're building/using. You can put this in your front end repo, your back end repo, or both.

GET /api/users
Returns a list of all users. Response JSON looks like this:

{ 
  id: 111,
  username: "johndoe",
  firstname: "John",
  lastname: "Doe",
  etc: "etc"
}
POST /api/users
Creates a new user. Say more about that here. Send this data:

{ this is what it takes as data }
And this is what it returns:

{ this is what you get back }
Wireframe / Mockup
Put your sweet wireframes and mockup images here. Probably only goes in the front end repo.
